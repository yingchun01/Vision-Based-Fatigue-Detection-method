# Vision-Based-Fatigue-Detection-method
Official code for "[The Fatigue Status Feature of Bicycle Movement Based on Deep Learning and Signal Processing Technology]". This work presents a non-invasive, vision-based method using Keypoint RCNN and Multiscale Entropy (MSE) to extract the CIA-AC biomarker for fatigue assessment in cyclists. Data and code are provided for full reproducibility.
